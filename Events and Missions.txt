Datacard Desplay
    find a sprite or picture online that has transparency that can be used as a datacard background ( should look like holo data pad), you have had a little bit of work with e sprite draw function
    so just like the draw sprite function for what you did witht he planets, create a new function in warclub
     called DrawDataCard this will draw the data card for a unit, it iwill take a instance of a unit class and draw all related datacard
    like you can see on the websight
    
    load in data card blank
        Pull Ork boys data sheet and edit for generic sheet
        load on monogame pipline creater
        add in to simulation
        add to draw function

    draw data sheet info to card
        draw first unit name in default unit to name location
        add all other items to draw.       using for each loops to create the drawing of multiple items into section

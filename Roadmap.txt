    we are going to build, sight, our select unit system, 
    step one    select unit system will be a class that can be instatuated
                 it will take in it's constructor a list of the factions units.
                it will save this list as a local variable in its class. and all cicial calls for units will pull from this list. 
                keep track of all units that have been selected and exlclude them from further selections.
                ask a bunch of questions.
                right nwo we have a system that lets us select units. and that function is static we pass in a list of units and we tell it a point value and we tell it ratioous
                now the problem is betwnbee calls tot hat select there is nothing that holds onto that list of units that we selected and we are trying to fix that 
                one of the things we could do is we are trying to do a cheeky
